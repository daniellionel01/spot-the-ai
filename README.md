# spot the ai

this is a test to see if you can spot the difference between real and ai generated images.

there are two modes:
- identify: you will be presented two images. a real one and an ai generated one. you have to identify the ai generated one.
- guess: you will be presented only one image, and you have to guess, wether it's real or ai generated.

the images display a variety of different kind of images to show different strengths and weaknesses of ai generated images. the images will include portraits, people, structures, animals, art & drawings, nature, astronomy, physics

the ai generated images were generated with [midjourney](https://midjourney.com/). all real images are taken from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and linked to their original source & creator to give credit.
